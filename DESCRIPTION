Description: Implementation of the Hysteretic and Gatekeeping Depressions Model (HGDM) which calculates variable connected/contributing areas and resulting discharge volumes in prairie basins dominated by depressions ("slough" or "potholes"). The small depressions are combined into a single "meta" depression which explicitly models the hysteresis between the storage of water and the connected/contributing areas of the depressions. The largest (greater than 5% of the total depressional areas) depression (if it exists) is represented separately to model its gatekeeping, i.e. the blocking of upstream flows until it is filled.
